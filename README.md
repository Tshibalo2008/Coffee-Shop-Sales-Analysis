# Analysis Breakdown

#
1.1. Revenue Analysis by Store
# 
Key findings or Insights

Hell’s Kitchen contributes the largest share of total revenue at 34%

Astoria and Lower Manhattan generate nearly equal revenue shares, showing balanced performance

Overall, revenue distribution across stores is consistent, suggesting stable sales patterns across all locations

#
1.2. Store Revenue by Month vs Store Revenue by Time of Day

#
Key findings or Insights

Steady Monthly Growth:

Revenue shows a consistent upward trend from January through June, with June being the highest-earning month. This indicates increasing customer engagement and possibly seasonal growth in coffee consumption

Morning Dominates Daily Sales:

The morning period (6 AM – 11:59 AM) generates the highest revenue across all stores. This aligns with customer habits of purchasing coffee and breakfast items before or during work hours.

Afternoon and Evening Declines: Sales drop noticeably after midday, suggesting fewer customer visits or smaller purchase volumes later in the day. The night hours contribute minimally to total revenue.

# 
Business Implication

Focus marketing and staffing efforts during morning hours and peak months (May–June) to maximize efficiency. Consider promotions or menu adjustments to boost sales during afternoons and evenings

#
1.3. Store Revenue by Time of Day vs Hourly Revenue Trend Across Store Locations

#
Key findings or Insights

#
Morning dominates revenue generation

The morning period (6 AM – 11 AM) consistently drives the highest revenue across all store locations, with over 60% of total daily sales occurring during this window

This reflects strong breakfast and early coffee demand

Afternoon and evening sales decline gradually

Revenues drop notably after midday, with steady but lower performance during afternoon and evening hours.

#
This pattern suggests fewer customers in-store later in the day, possibly due to work schedules or reduced commuter traffic

#
Nighttime revenue is negligible

Sales after 8 PM are almost non-existent, implying minimal late-night demand and limited business justification for extended operating hours.

#
Operational insight

The business could optimize staffing and inventory around morning peaks and explore promotions or delivery options to boost afternoon and evening performance

# 
2. Insights on Product Sales

#
2.1. Total Revenue by Product Category vs Revenue by Product Category and Store

#
Coffee and Tea dominate total sales

Coffee contributes the highest share of total revenue at 38.6%, followed by Tea at 28.1%

Together, these two categories account for over two-thirds of total sales, highlighting their central role in driving the business

Moderate performance in Bakery and Drinking Chocolate

Bakery (11.8%) and Drinking Chocolate (10.4%) are strong secondary contributors, performing consistently across all store locations.

#
Low-performing categories

Coffee Beans, Branded Items, Loose Tea, Flavours, and Packaged Chocolate contribute minimally (<6% each), indicating potential underperformance or niche demand

#
Business Opportunity

Focus marketing and promotions on Coffee and Tea to maintain strength

Explore ways to boost sales in lower-performing categories through bundling, sampling, or limited-time offers

#
3. Revenue by Day of Week

# 
Key findings or Insights

#
Weekday sales are strong and consistent

Revenue remains steady from Monday to Friday, ranging between R99,000 and R102,000

The highest revenue occurs on Monday (R102,000), possibly due to routine morning commutes or early-week coffee demand

Slight dip on weekends

Revenue declines on Saturday (R97,000) and Sunday (R98,000), suggesting lower foot traffic or reduced operational hours

This pattern indicates that weekday business drives the bulk of total revenue

#
Operational insight

The business could maintain weekday staffing and inventory levels, while considering cost optimizations on weekends

Alternatively, weekend promotions (e.g., family combos, brunch specials, or loyalty discounts) could help stimulate demand

#
4. Total Revenue vs Quantity Sold

#
Key findings or Insights

#
May and June recorded the highest sales and quantities sold, with June leading overall performance

This trend aligns with the winter season, when colder weather drives increased consumption of coffee and tea as customers seek warmth

Overall, revenue and sales volumes remained stable across the six-month period, indicating consistent customer demand throughout the year

# Conclusions and Recommendations For Bright Coffee Shop

#
1. Focus on Peak Months

May and June show the highest sales — leverage this by launching seasonal winter promotions (e.g., “Winter Warmers” coffee and tea specials)

Consider stocking up on coffee and tea supplies ahead of winter to meet higher demand

#
2. Enhance Morning Operations

The morning period generates the most revenue across all stores

Improve morning service efficiency, staffing, and product availability to maximize sales during these crucial hours

Introduce breakfast combos or loyalty rewards for early customers

#
3. Optimize Store Performance

#
Hell’s Kitchen leads slightly in total revenue, but Astoria and Lower Manhattan show comparable performance

Use best practices from the top-performing store (e.g., promotions, layout, customer flow) and apply them across all locations

Explore localised marketing to attract nearby office workers and commuters.

#
4. Expand High-Performing Product Lines

#
Coffee and Tea contribute over 65% of total revenue, prioritize them in marketing campaigns and seasonal menus

Upsell bakery items and drinking chocolate, which have solid secondary performance, especially during colder months

Evaluate low-performing products (e.g., packaged chocolate, loose tea) for menu optimisation or bundling opportunities

#
5. Maintain Weekday Consistency

#
Revenue remains stable across weekdays, with a slight dip on weekends

#
6. Data-Driven Growth

#
Continue tracking hourly and daily sales trends to fine-tune staffing, inventory, and promotions

Use insights from sales data to forecast demand and improve decision-making for upcoming quarters
